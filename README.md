## About Project
Platforms like Telegram lacks a channel discovery feature where you could join groups/channels that you would be interested in. At the moment the only way to discover new channels is through word of mouth or by specifically searching for that channel. This solution would classify telegram channels by category and suggest interesting channels in realtime. Moreover it connect business owners with channel admins who would like to promote their product by statically proven gatherd data.
